# PacMen Exercise
Description: This project randomly creates PacMen that bounce around the window with edge detection. To opperate the project you will need to create a PacMan to move by clicking on add PacMan. Then start the game by clicking on start game. The PacMan will then start to bounce around. You can create more by clicking add PacMan again.
I plan on improving this by adding elements to turn the pacmen around depending on their direction. I may also ad edge detection to this.

Licence information - This project was completed in the MIT xPro Course.
